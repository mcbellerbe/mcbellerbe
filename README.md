- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcbellerbe, and I go by Matt.
- 👀 I’m interested in pivoting career industries into the IT field, and haven't quite figured out where I fit. I am interested in programming but have never
thought I'd be able to actually do it. I'm just here to learn, one step at a time and hopefully do something useful with a skill I've always wanted to pursue
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and dabbling in Python, and planning to expand to C++ as I get a firmer grip on C. I heard that C was easier to learn before starting in on C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything, but I don't know if I trust myself enough yet to get out there and mess up someone else's project.
- 📫 I haven't set up an email account specifically for programming project correspondence, but if you really need to email me for something I'm at mcbellerbe@gmail.com
